# ZIV SERPHOS Cyber4s 3rd Pre-Course Final Project

## What I have build

Welcome everyone to my pre-course final project. You are going to see a task-management application.

My project was a Kanban page with three tasks list (one for "todo" tasks the second is for "in-progress" tasks and one is for "done" tasks) that has multiple functions and help the user manage his tasks in easy way.

i started with basic requirments for example save my data in the local storage and show the user his tasks even if refresh the page or exit from him. i added some features like move task from <ul> list to another <ul> list by pressing alt+1/2/3 (1 for "todo" section 2 for "in-progress" section and 3 for "done" section). i also made each task to be content editable in case the user double clicked a specific input. for the comfort i added search input for the user to filter between tasks.

as a bonus i added cool animation when user is press on add task to any <ul> list. it was importent for me to work on my own animation in order to improve my css and js abilities. 

also nice feature that will make user life easier is drag and drop function that allows drag with the mouse tasks into other sections and of course save it in the local storage.

there is 3 buttons below the "todo" section the save one is to send an api PUT request with current tasks that are shown in the page, the load is like undo that refresh the local storage according to current api and also update the DOM. "clear all" button used for delate all tasks.

# importent things you should know:

- all tasks that are added/moved/dragged to a <ul> list are insert to the top of the list in order to help the user see the change at the same moment.

- while editing task content background will turn into pink, when out of focus data wil be save and the task background will return to be white

- you cant add an empty task

- you can filter tasks using key words that are written in the tasks

of course all tests have passed😉😃👏

# Your more than welcome to use my page and manage your tasks, enjoy!.
